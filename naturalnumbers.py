# If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
#  we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
# Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the
#  multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.
# Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0.
# Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, 
# only count it once.

def solution(number):
    # Check if the number is negative
    if number < 0:
        return 0

    # Initialize the sum
    total_sum = 0

    # Iterate through all numbers below the given number
    for i in range(number):
        # Check if the number is a multiple of 3 or 5
        if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
            total_sum += i

    return total_sum
